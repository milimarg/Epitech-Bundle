# Soul Connection - EPITECH

This repository contains the code for our joint project between EPITECH and Soul Connection.
The goal of this project is to create a web application for dating coaches to manage their clients and provide them with guidance.
The project is divided into two parts:

- the FrontEnd (representing what the user will see)
- the BackEnd (managing data and routes of the application)

## FrontEnd

Developed in **TypeScript** and using `React` technology, the goal of the FrontEnd is to provide a smooth and enjoyable user experience.
For more details on the FrontEnd, refer to the `README.md` file in the `frontend` folder.

## BackEnd

Developed in **TypeScript**, using the `Prisma` ORM and the `Express` library, the BackEnd handles most of the data processing and client requests, passing them to the FrontEnd for display.
For more details on the BackEnd, refer to the `README.md` file in the `backend` folder.
