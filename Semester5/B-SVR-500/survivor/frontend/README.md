# FrontEnd

Our FrontEnd is designed for responsiveness and seamless user experience. Weâ€™ve utilized modern tools to ensure optimal performance and a polished interface.

## Core Technologies

### React

We use `React` for building user interfaces. It allows us to create fast, scalable, and interactive web applications through a component-based architecture.

### Material UI

For the user interface design, we chose `Material UI (MUI)`, a comprehensive library of pre-built components. It provides an intuitive, accessible, and consistent design language, allowing us to implement UI elements efficiently while maintaining visual appeal and responsiveness.

### TypeScript

To ensure type safety and improved code readability, we leverage `TypeScript` throughout the application. This helps prevent errors and provides better tooling and developer experience.

## Communication with the BackEnd

### Axios

For handling HTTP requests and communicating with the BackEnd, we use `Axios`. This lightweight promise-based HTTP client simplifies sending requests to our API, ensuring smooth data fetching, error handling, and interaction with the BackEnd.
