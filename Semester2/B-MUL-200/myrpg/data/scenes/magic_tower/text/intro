Ah, greetings, young one.
Apologies for dozing off. I do tend to get lost in my thoughts, you see.
Well then, since you're here, perhaps you could be of assistance to an old, forgetful wizard like me.
You see, I'm right in the middle of brewing a most potent potion of healing. But alas, I've run out of the crucial ingredient - Moonbloom! It's a remarkable herb with silvery petals that have the power to enhance the healing properties of potions. Quite essential, you see.
My old bones aren't as spry as they used to be, and I can't venture out to gather it myself. Would you be willing to help me, dear stranger?
I need three of those plants. They often grow around trees.
