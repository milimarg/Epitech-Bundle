Listen carefully, stranger.
You stand accused of theft, and your fate rests in my hands. You have two options: rot in your cell for the rest of your miserable life, or prove your worth through three quests that I shall assign to you.
The first quest is to find and eliminate a group of pillagers that have been terrorizing our lands. Bring me the head of their leader as proof of your success.
Should you succeed, the second quest will be to aid the court wizard, in whatever task he requires of you. He is facing a dire situation, and he will explain the details to you himself.
The third and final quest...is the most treacherous of all.
You will need to navigate Dante's Maze, a labyrinth known for its deadly traps and formidable challenges. At its heart lies a relic that I seek. Bring it back to me, and your debt shall be repaid.
