Beyond this door lies a treacherous maze.
Many have ventured into the maze in search of the relic, but few have returned. It is not for the faint of heart or the weak of spirit.
Go forth, but tread carefully. The maze holds many enemies and challenges that can test even the bravest of souls. May you find what you seek.
