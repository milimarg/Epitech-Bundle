Look, I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance
Something's wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
Just a|128|8| I've got, like s|100|11|about to happen, but I don't know what
If that means, what I think i|23|10|e're in trouble, big|13|9|
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
You were just what the doctor ordered
I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God,|9|8|
All my people from the front to the back nod,|10|9|
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box,|10|9|?
They said I rap|160|8|robot, so call me Rapbot
But for me to|50|12|computer must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot|293|8|at rap profit
Made a living and a killing off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky|846|8| on his nut-sack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and indecent as all hell syllables, killaholic (Kill 'em all with)
This slickety, gibbedy, hibbedy hip hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappidy brat
Packing a Mac in|653|10|of the Ac, backpack rap crap, yep, yackidy-yac
And at the exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing
That I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over|856|10|of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a Maxipad
It's actually disastrously bad
For the wack|376|11|masterfully constructing this masterpiece as|1284|167|Let me show you maintain|214|9|shit ain't that hard,|11|10|
Everybody want the key and the secret|1328|8|immortality like I have got
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance|146|11|loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the earth like an asteroid, did nothing but sh|69|8|the moon since
MC's get taken to school|1107|11|music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme
Now I lead a new|86|8|full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac N-
-W.A, Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired|1890|11|one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run DMC|1562|8|uct them into the|1214|15|Rock n'
Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I walk|1454|8|church and burst in a ball of flames
Only|81|13| I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags|2462|9|'s all a game 'til|166|8|a flock|140|12|ff of planking, tell me what|1668|8|fuck are you thinking?
Little gay looking boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face|60|13|You witnessing a mass occur
Like you watching a|368|8|gathering take pl|88|16|Oy vey, that boy's gay, tha|303|8|they s|204|15|You get a thumbs up, pat o|1950|10|
And a "way to go" from your label everyd|296|15|Hey,|313|12|, what|2842|8||339|12|?|2521|9|"hell yeah" from Dr|321|14|I'mma work for everything I have
Never ask nobody for shit, get outta my|411|18|Basically boy|3196|8|never gonna be capable
To keep up|2284|8|e same p|497|16||1192|8||3013|100|The way I'm racing around the track,|2952|9|Nascar, Nascar
Dale Earnhardt|2449|8|trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard
So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off then I'm reloading immediately|2704|8|ese bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm|1166|8|king dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
But I got your mom deep throating
I'm out my Ramen noodle, we have|1849|9|in common, poodle
I'm a doberman, pinch yourself|2914|8|arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it'|3196|8|ly futile if|3920|9|utilize|3903|8|do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to maybe to try and help get some|3871|8|through t|2790|9|s|433|10|ta keep a few punchlines just in case 'cause even you unsigned|2895|14|ungr|1605|10|at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king|3382|8|undergroun|671|8| still|3976|10|I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunc|323|8|, but sometimes when you combine
Appea|2454|9|e skin color of mine|1627|9|too big and here they come trying to
Censor you like that one line I said on "I'm Back"|4316|10|Mathers LP
One|4082|8|tried to say "I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put|3872|9|in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine"
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was|1106|9|
Morphin' into an|3042|9| coming|687|10|he portal
You're stuck in|560|9|arp from 2004|917|8|And|4874|18||2305|10|t|1950|8|rhyme for|95|8|pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows
You write normal, fuck being normal
And I just bought a new Raygun|4790|11|uture
Just to come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad|3112|8|Fab said he looked|4930|8|fag at Maywhether's pad
Singin' to a man while they played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special|2383|8|cable channel
So Ray J went|2613|10|to the radio station the very next day
"Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you"
Lyrics|567|8|at you at supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)
Uh, sama lamaa du|11|9|you assuming I'm a human
Wha|1323|10|do|5633|8|it|1368|11| you I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything|5454|8| is ricochet|5001|8|of me and it'll glue to you
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give|4586|17|audience|5764|11||1472|11|evitating
Never fading, and |1491|9|at the hat|4454|8|forever waiting|4394|9|day|48|9|y can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating|3860|10||1605|8| |2995|8|et 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you|26|12|or music
Oh, he's too mainstream|4201|8|hat's|5826|9|y do when they get jealous,|1533|8|nfuse it
It's not|5228|8|, it's pop,|1884|8|I found a hella|213|8||66|8|With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on Lose Y|2331|8|and make 'em lose it

It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many|76|8||2263|8|murder to
Prove that if y|6288|8|half as nice, your songs you can sacrifice virgins too uh!
School flunkie, pill junky
But look|5563|8|accolades|2114|8|lls brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself|2441|8|I make me do|6614|8|put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you, ill|6204|8|speak in tongues|2842|10|still tongue in cheek, fuck|1152|10|runk so Satan take|4212|9|ing wheel, I'm asleep|5913|8|front seat
Bumping Heavy D|5137|9|Boys, still chunky, but f|368|9|in my head there's|6957|10||7048|12|tugg|6377|8|struggling
Angels fight with devils an|5642|10||6841|8|y want from me
They asking me to eliminate som|747|8| women hate
Bu|648|9|take into consider|1800|10|bitter hatred|4088|8|T|2723|8|may be a little patient and more sympathetic|6930|8|situation
And underst|5495|8|discrimination
But fuck it, life's hand|1704|8|lemons, make lemonade then|224|8|I can't bat|6090|8|women how|4752|11|m I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake it for Satan
It's a fatal|34|10|f|4839|10| I need to be overseas
And take a vacation to trip a broad
A|1346|8|her fall on her fac|3484|8|n't be a retard
Be a king? Think not, why b|26|8||3179|11|an be a God?
