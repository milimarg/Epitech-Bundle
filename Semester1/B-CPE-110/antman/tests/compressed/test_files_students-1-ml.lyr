To say it's love would be too simple
Too obvious
It's more like a calling, a vocation
Something I was
Put on this earth to do
Now I'm shooting with the stars
And I'm fly|30|13|angels
And my heartbeat is a symphony the
Closer I get to you
I never saw you comin' till you
Came and here you are|54|9|thought someone
Would ever dare
To come this far
You're up for the resistance|226|9|strong in my persiste|33|10|ve never known

I'd have to go back bein'
That broken soul you found
Those days are in the darkness

Your life is like anchor that puts

And the wisdom in your eye

Finally see
That we had love
That you don't find easily
You broke|1125|9| and the price

Losing w|120|8|ha|835|22|My words have come to late
I've already turned that page
Don't you look at me back and
That's the part I hate
I'll stay trapped inside my hell
Where it's so hot
That my walls melt
And I can hear a promise
In every lie you said
