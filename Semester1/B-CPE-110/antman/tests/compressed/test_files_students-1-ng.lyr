We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand
Never gonna give you up|24|13|let you down|49|13|run around and desert you|87|13||119|9|cry|112|13|say goodbye|136|13|tell a lie and hurt you
We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it
Inside we both know wha|68|9|going on
We|478|10|game and we're gonna play it
And if you ask me|403|17|Don't tell me|155|12|blind to se|279|14||415|160||587|172||759|16|, n|777|15|
